## Image Compression using K-Means Clustering ##
### Overview ###
This project demonstrates image compression using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By representing an image with a reduced number of colors, we can compress the image while retaining its essential visual features. This method involves clustering the pixel colors in an image and replacing them with the colors of the centroids of the clusters.
